Hi all! This is just a quick post about a better/more sophisticated way of writing counterclaims that my school English teacher mentioned to me a couple days ago. 

So, in elementary and middle school, we are taught to write a claim and to support that with evidence and reasoning. Then, in high school, we are taught to write two body paragraphs, each with a "C", "E", and "R", and occasionally, we are instructed to add a full counter-claim paragraph that either has the "CER" format or just simply a "CR" format.

However, I never realized that we could actually just add our counterclaims within our two body paragraphs. If the claim that we are arguing for isn't a pro/con perspective, we could demonstrate why we support a certain perspective even further by acknowledging why some people might not support this perspective, and then refuting that *within our body paragraphs*.

That's all; this was just something I never realized before. Have a great rest of your day!
